# state-migration.tf
#
# Grants this project's LOCAL role (aws_iam_role.github_actions_role, oidc-setup.tf) the
# two things S2 Task 2 rides on one bootstrap/ apply (archived plan: sprints/_archive/
# S2_identity_least_privilege/sprint_plan.md, Task 2; both policies are deleted with the role
# by S2-T4 step 4, issue #139): KMS access to the upstream BR-D22 state-encryption key, and the
# read-only org-bucket bridge Task 3 needs. Both target the LOCAL role specifically because
# CI still authenticates as it today -- Task 0c already granted the identical KMS statement
# to both UPSTREAM roles (glunk-works/global-bootstrap's project_policies.tf and
# plan_roles.tf, Sid "StateEncryptionKeyAccess"), verified live. This file is the local-root
# mirror for the window before Task 4 cuts CI over to those roles.
#
# Everything here is as temporary as bootstrap/ itself: Task 4 retires the local role in
# favour of the upstream ones, and Task 5 deletes bootstrap/ outright. Neither resource below
# is a candidate to "converge on least privilege" in place -- same footnote as
# state-backend.tf's MW-T5 widen.
#
# ⚠️ RESIDUAL, recorded rather than fixed (security-critic pass, S2-T2, both HIGH). This
# root's local role -- unlike either upstream role Task 0c granted the identical KMS
# statement to -- also holds state-backend.tf's MW-T5 flat s3:PutBucket*/s3:ListBucket on
# Resource = "*" (that policy's own comment already flags this for narrowing "outside of
# lab use" and is explicitly NOT to be converged on in place; it is deleted wholesale, not
# edited, by Task 4). Before this file, that flat grant could reach the org state bucket's
# policy and objects but not decrypt them -- this root had zero kms: grants anywhere. This
# file supplies the missing kms:Decrypt on the SAME key that (once other glunk-works
# projects adopt native state encryption) protects every project's state, so the local
# role's pre-existing over-broad S3 reach and this file's new KMS reach compose into a
# theoretical path to another project's plaintext state via a rewritten bucket policy.
# Not mitigated here: a `kms:EncryptionContext` condition is the right-shaped fix but
# requires confirming what encryption context OpenTofu's native state encryption actually
# sets (unmeasured) before it can be added without risking a silent fail-closed; a
# `kms:ViaService` condition is the WRONG axis (native encryption calls KMS client-side,
# not via S3, and would fail closed). Also unrecorded until now: this grant sits on a role
# whose OIDC trust still admits `:pull_request` (F2, open) for the Task 2 -> Task 4 window,
# so a same-repo PR branch could in principle reach this capability before Task 4 retires
# the local role. Both points belong in Task 4's residual register, not fixed in place here.

# The upstream BR-D22 key (glunk-works/global-bootstrap's aws_kms_key.state_key, output
# state_kms_key_arn) and the org state bucket (aws_s3_bucket.state_bucket, output
# state_bucket_name) both live in a different root's state -- there is nothing in this root
# to derive either from, and both embed the account id, so neither gets a committed default
# (BR-D4; mirrors global-bootstrap's own bootstrap_bucket_name and
# bedrock_rag_source_bucket_name, which use the identical no-default cross-repo pattern).

# while empty, so the next apply has nothing to decrypt and needs GenerateDataKey to write
# ciphertext from scratch. Both verbs are granted; only the reasoning changed.

# 2. The read-only org-bucket bridge (Task 3, F43 part 1) -- specified there, applied here so

# NOT a privilege increase on the S3 ListBucket/GetObject axis specifically -- but say why
# precisely, per security-critic (S2-T2): state_access_policy's own statement 2
# (state-backend.tf) already grants unconditioned s3:ListBucket on Resource = "*" (the

# spec verbatim. See the file-level comment for the KMS-side residual this combination opens
# that the S3 scoping alone does not close.
